title: Understanding CNNs Through Visualization (part 2)
---

I've finally uploaded part 2 of my visualization blog, which visualizes relations
between features in ConvNets. You can see it [here](/why_cat_2/).
It comes with some [code](https://github.com/mcogswell/cnn_treevis)
that visualizes relations between features in AlexNet.

If you haven't read [part 1](/why_cat/) yet then you might want to start
with that.
