title: About Me
---

In 2013 I completed bachelor of science degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics
at Virginia Tech and liked the place well enough to stay a while longer.
Currently, I'm a PhD student working on Machine Learning and Computer Vision with
[Dhruv Batra](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/) -- also at Virginia Tech.
Below you'll find more about what I do and why.

Apart from research, I've been an active fencer since 2005. Check out the
[VT fencing page](http://www.fencing.org.vt.edu/) if you're interested in
fencing at Virginia Tech.


Why AI?
===

Like many, I fondly remember stories told by science communicators
like Brian Greene and Neil deGrasse Tyson.
They marveled at Newton's laws then revealed the existence of more accurate theories
whose existence had been unexpected: Special Relativity, General Relativity, Quantum
Mechanics.
The idea that nature could be misunderstood at a fundamental level, but that we could slowly, systematically
reveal hidden layers led me to think of science as one of the most
worthwhile pursuits.

Nonetheless, I became interested in computers. I knew scientific understanding
had made possible their existence, but computers were interesting because I 
could design and implement programs -- I was not motivated by a desire to discover
things about machines. My interest led to degrees in Computer Science
(engineering processes for machines) and Mathematics. Each was quite interesting
on its own, but neither endeavor seemed to lead me to anything like the mystique
of physics at the start of the 20th century. 
Mathematics led to unsolved problems which were all either grand and unsolvable
(by me) or uninteresting.
Computer Science seemed much the same. There were plenty of scientific problems,
but none of them seemed that exciting. It was more worthwhile, more fun, to apply 
what I had learned to engineer software, like most of my peers.

So I was accepted as a co-op at IBM and found myself working on a data analytics project.
This was a satisfying experience and left me with the impression that I could
have a successful, fulfilling career in software development. The particular
project I worked on left me with some knowledge of Machine Learning (ML) and a desire
to pursue it further. Partly for the co-op, and partly for my own interest,
I learned about the field and was lucky to discover how most of the tools I had pursued
were used in this one area. That, by itself, wasn't enough to maintain interest.
Like ML, Numerical Analysis used my interests to a similar degree, but
I had already ruled that out as uninteresting. Still, ML had a certain appeal,
so I looked into it more.

While at IBM, I applied to the 5-year Masters program in the CS department and
began looking for advisors in Machine Learning.
Since I was already interested in Computer Vision, Dr. Dhruv Batra seemed like the
perfect fit, and I've been lucky enough to work with him for my MS and PhD.
Recently, we've focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

In particular, CNNs help illustrate a point I've discovered while learning about
Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Problems in this field sometimes feel grand (like Relativity and Quantum Mechanics) 
and we're making a lot of progress very quickly (as pysicists did in the first
half of the 20th century).
In 2012, some researchers edited the previous iteration of CNNs and
ended up producing spectacular results on a fundamental problem
in Computer Vision. That year and in every year since, large gains have been
made on that and similar problems using CNNs.
Progress like this and anticipation of harder problems
yet to be solved, yet to be posed, are what drive me to participate in research.

Since my interests line up well and I draw motivation from the field's
potential, AI and ML seem like the right place for me.
