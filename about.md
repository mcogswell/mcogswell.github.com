title: About Me
---

I'm a PhD student working on deep learning with applications in vision and language.
In 2016 I completed Master of Science degree at Virginia Tech with [Dhruv Batra][dhruv_page].
I continued working on my PhD with Dhruv then Georgia Tech with him in 2017.
I sit in the [CODA building](https://codatechsquare.com/)
and you can reach me at michael dot a dot cogswell at gmail.

Research Interests

{: .anchor #research_interests}

I'm interested in AI, in understanding how intelligence can be constructed
and through that how it works.
In particular, the complex models allowed [Deep Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)
open up a number of new questions that interest me:

* What representation of knowledge do these networks learn? How can we
understand those representations and the process by which they are learned?
How do we measure and evaluate this understanding?

* Where do deep networks fail? Why?

* What principles do deep networks take advantage of at the moment?
What principles are missing? How can we incorporate new principles?


I like to explore these questions in the context of computer vision.
My tool set and mode of thinking fits well into this domain, but the
domain is also ripe with problems that interest me.
Vision problems offer raw inputs which require complex models of
perception to understand. Still, effective vision systems exist in
animals, so at least part of the problem is simple enough to solve
without more complex human-like abstractions.

I wrote an [essay](/blog/why_ai) about how I got interested in the field a while ago.


Other Interests

Aside from research, I've been an active fencer since 2005, competing in
club collegiate tournaments and USFA events (mostly in the
[Virginia Division][vadiv]). I'm currently a C2018 in foil.
I fence at the [Eagle Fencing Club][eagle] and sometimes Georgia Tech's
[Yellow Jacket Fencing Club][gtfencing].
