title: About Me

In 2013 I completed bachelor of science degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics
at Virginia Tech and liked the place well enough to stay a while longer.
Currently, I'm a PhD student working on Machine Learning and Computer Vision with
[Dhruv Batra][dhruv_page] -- also at Virginia Tech.
Check out my [research interests](#ri) below and [this essay](/2015/03/15/whyai/)
I wrote to find out more about what I do.

Apart from research, I've been an active fencer since 2005, competing in
club collegiate tournaments and USFA events (mostly in the
[Virginia Division][vadiv]). The last time I updated this
page I was a [C2014][ratings] in foil. Check out the
[VT fencing page][vtfencing] if you're interested in
fencing at Virginia Tech.

Research Interests {#ri}
==================

I want to scale the ability of Machine Learning toward AI by developing models
that encompass an increasing amount what we call intelligence. That's hard,
and I can only do a small part of it. In particular, I'm
[focusing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWNBzAgAiMc) on Deep Learning
(today's neural networks) with applications to Computer Vision (vision).

I suppose I'm something like a [connectionist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism).
I want to design modules and connect them together in a way that improves
[deep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)
[neural networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network).
Hopefully this involves experimentation and theory, each pushing the other
to new heights as is often the case in science.


Currently I focus on vision for a couple reasons:

* I like to think visually, so I find vision problems intuitive.

* There's an active vision community which is integrated with the ML community
and serves as a great melting pot for ideas as well as a place I can go
to figure out which ideas are good and which are bad.

* _Vision problems are complex._ Start by building parts of intelligent
systems and gradually understanding those, but eventually you need to connect
the parts to build a system that's not singly focused. [^parts]
To do (my kind of) vision, one must recognize patterns in images then connect
those patterns with other knowledge to form new patterns [^complex_vision].

* _Vision problems are simple._ Somehow, vision seems like a smallest
possible subset of intelligence that maintains the above complexity.
Animals can replicate a significant amount of the human visual system, but
they tend not to be able to do things like write and speak language.

I'm still fairly new to the field, so all this could change in a couple years :)
