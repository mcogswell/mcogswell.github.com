title: About Me
---

In 2013 I completed bachelor of science degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics
at Virginia Tech and liked the place well enough to stay a while longer.
Currently, I'm a PhD student working on Machine Learning and Computer Vision with
[Dhruv Batra][dhruv_page].

Research Interests

{: .anchor #research_interests}

I'm interested in AI, in understanding how intelligence can be constructed
and through that how it works.
In particular, the complex models allowed [Deep Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)
open up a number of new questions that interest me:

* What representation of knowledge do these networks learn? How can we
understand those representations and the process by which they are learned?
How do we measure and evaluate this understanding?

* Where do deep networks fail? Why?

* What principles do deep networks take advantage of at the moment?
What principles are missing? How can we incorporate new principles?


I like to explore these questions in the context of computer vision.
My tool set and mode of thinking fits well into this domain, but the
domain is also ripe with problems that interest me.
Vision problems offer raw inputs which require complex models of
perception to understand. Still, effective vision systems exist in
animals, so at least part of the problem is simple enough to solve
without more complex human-like abstractions.

I wrote an [essay](/blog/why_ai) about how I got interested in the field a while ago.

Aside from research, I've been an active fencer since 2005, competing in
club collegiate tournaments and USFA events (mostly in the
[Virginia Division][vadiv]). I'm currently a C2014 in foil.
Check out the [VT fencing page][vtfencing] if you're interested in
fencing at Virginia Tech.
