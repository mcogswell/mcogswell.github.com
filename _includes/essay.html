<h1>Markdown</h1>

<h3>Michael Cogswell writing for New Horizons</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Markdown is a simple way to format text so it can accurately and precisely
convey meaning while maintaining properties desired by advanced computer users.
It came about as a way to make life easier for people who not only spend
their days working at computers, but also work in fields about computers.</p>

<p>When working with computers, as in most fields, one needs to do a lot of writing, but
in this field one needs to do a lot of writing in special environments.
Specifically, the writing needs to happen on a computer (typed in with the keyboard)
and it needs to be easily dealt with by many different computers.</p>

<p>text files are what you can directly enter on your computer using just the keyboard.
they include letters, numbers, and punctuation, but not words emphasized with bold or itallics or text with differnt sizes</p>

<p>I assume most readers are familiar with Microsoft Word (or a similar program)
and with browsing the Internet, but I'll provide a quick description to point
out the features that matter here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Word -- coloquially, Word -- allows amateur computer users to create fairly complex documents
that include features you might find in a professionally created book;
figures, tables, headings, lists, headers, footers, different fonts, and
itallics text are all features you might find in a Word document.</li>
<li>The Internet is experienced most frequently through a web browser
(e.g. Chrome or Fire Fox). One job of a web browser is to take text files formatted in the
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) -- something you can enter with your keyboard --
and turn them into the web pages you see when browsing the web -- something you can't type
in with your keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I can describe some of the minor problems that arise for computing professionals
which are solved by markdown.</p>

<ul>
<li>Computers run on different operating systems and have different editors.
The editors might work with some formats and not others. </li>
</ul>

<p>'normal' text is not formatted
in most editors they allow things like bold, itallics, headers, lists,</p>

<p>particularly using comparison with editing in microsoft word and HTML</p>

<p>It solves these problems.... (instead of it came about because...)</p>

<p>most often used for publishing things on the web (e.g. simple blogs, ..)</p>

<p>Markdown emerges from already present informal formatting (think email)</p>

<p>history (how did it come about?)
what is it
what does it look like
what does it do
how do you use it</p>

<p>(coloquially, Word)</p>

<p>plain text vs formatted text</p>

<p>from blog:
    easy to learn (though there still is a learning curve)
    fast to write while still generating HTML, word.... (for the same effect)
    clean -- generates perfect HTML (good for converting further)
    portable -- can read/edit on any platform (just requires a text editor... why is word not a text editor)... small size
    flexible -- many formats.. web, email, word, layout program, 
    fits any workflow --
ask what word and HTML don't provide
also, non-gui systems</p>

<p>design principles -- simplicity</p>

<p>why it came about</p>

<pre><code>light weight markup language
plain text
    why?
    programmers use plain text
    problems with word
    problems with simple text
        readability

        compatible with other formats
came from frequent but informal conventions

similar to html (what is html)
</code></pre>

<h2>Operating Description</h2>

<p>Markdown is written in plain text, which means the text does not need
to be processed to take its final form. Writing markdown is just typing
text into an editor while following certain rules.
Markdown is just formatted text.</p>

<p>To make this distinction clear, the examples below show both the Markdown
formatted text (on the left) and how the corresponding HTML would be rendered in a web browser (on the right).</p>

<p>write it in a text file (ACII?)</p>

<h2>Description of Parts and their Function</h2>

<p>What follows are some examples of text written with Markdown formatting
and how that same text appears when translated to HTML and rendered in a browser.</p>

<h3>Emphasis</h3>

<p>Most authors are used to using <strong>bold</strong> or <em>itallics</em> to add meaning to documents
written on their computer. Markdown syntax allows you to do this in plain text
by surrounding things you want to make bold in pairs of underscores and by
surrounding thing you want to make itallic in single underscores.</p>

<h3>Headings</h3>

<p>In Markdown, headings are simply created by adding hash marks before the section name;
level one and two headers can be created by adding lines of equal signs or dashes, respectively.
This provides a way to create longer, yet still well organized plain text documents.</p>

<h3>Lists</h3>

<p>Both ordered and unordered lists can be created by preceeding each item with
a number, asterisk, or dash, just like many people do in emails.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p>Since Markdown is most commonly used to format quick things people type up
to put on the web, it provides a mechanism to insert links to web pages.

<h3>Blockquotes</h3>

<p>Finally, a blockquote can be created by putting greater than signs on the front
of the text being quoted.</p>

<h3>Arbitrary HTML</h3>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Above, I only listed a bit less than half of the formatting options available
in Markdown.</p>

<p>In fact this document was first written in Markdown then processed into a
word document.</p>

<p>The markdown version took up XX space while the word version uses XXX</p>
