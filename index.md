Hi! I'm a PhD student working with [Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/index.html) at Georgia Tech.
I try to understand Neural Networks, especially as applied to Computer Vision.
As deep networks become more widely used, I hope to find new ways for users
to understand the complex systems they use and to leverage this understanding
to build better models.
